## Development Guidelines

- All C constants/functions available under `crate::tmux_sys` module (generated by bindgen) with the same names, so most of the time there is no need to read src/tmux_sys.rs to understand what's inside.
- When porting code from C to Rust, bring over any original comments, but don't add your own.

## C-to-Rust Translation Patterns

C Function | Rust Equivalent
--- | ---
fatalx | panic!
log_debug | debug!
